# 2d Visibility Algorithm

The 2d visibility agolrithm described in [this article](http://www.redblobgames.com/articles/visibility/), ported by hand to modern JavaScript and refactored significantly to suit my taste better. So it's not quite a 1-to-1 port, but pretty close. I renamed things and opted for a more functional approach.

It's a fantastic article with some really awesome interactive examples and provides the code in multiple languages. The original code was wrriten in Haxe, which can compile into JavaScript but I found the generated JS to be rather difficult to read and comes with an (unncessary) doubly linked list implementation.
